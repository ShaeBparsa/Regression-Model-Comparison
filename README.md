# Regression-Model-Comparison
The machine learning project provides hands-on experience in applied machine learning, covering various aspects of the field, such as:

* Collecting data in diverse formats
* Preparing data for training and testing
* Training different types of regression models
* Performing hyperparameter searches
* Aggregating performance metrics across datasets
* Interpreting how trained models work
* The primary focus of the project is to compare different regression methods for tabular datasets and determine the best-performing method overall. The project evaluates the following regression models provided by scikit-learn:

Linear Regression
* Support Vector Regression
* Decision Tree Regression
* Random Forest Regression
* k-nearest neighbors Regression
* AdaBoost Regression
* Gaussian Process Regression
* Neural Network Regression
The project evaluates the performance of each regression model on eight different regression datasets sourced from the UCI repository:

- Wine Quality
- Communities and Crime
- QSAR aquatic toxicity
- Facebook metrics
- Bike Sharing
- Student Performance
- Concrete Compressive Strength
- SGEMM GPU kernel performance
